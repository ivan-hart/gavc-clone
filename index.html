            <h1>​What is Career Technical Education</h1>
            <p>​Career and technical education is the ticket to your future in today's technical job market. Career and technical education courses give you the chance to explore your interests, develop marketable skills that can lead to higher-paying jobs, and broaden your career options while earning credit toward your high school diploma. Career and technical education courses combine classroom instruction with hands-on laboratory experience. The Galesburg Area Vocational Center provides a variety of sophisticated occupational training programs. Competency-based instruction provides "hands-on" learning experiences. Students learn by performing actual job skills and are evaluated on the basis of what they can do and how well they do it.</p>
